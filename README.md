# pixel-perfect

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Motivation
Pixel art is fun, so are React and Redux! Here is a project involving all three of those of things.

## Usage
run `npm start` to start up the dev server

## TODO
* bucket fill
* user customization of grid size/pixel size
* ability to save/download finished pixel art
